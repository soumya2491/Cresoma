# 🌐 Cresoma

**Tagline:** *Play. Connect. Create.*  

Cresoma is a 3D interactive web space that combines entertainment with collaboration. It’s a place where friends can play games, chat, and connect, while also switching into a live dashboard for group study, brainstorming, or shared creative projects. With real-time updates and an immersive design, Cresoma makes learning as engaging as gaming, and gaming as social as hanging out in person.
